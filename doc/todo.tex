\section{Features Being Implemented}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Building from a document XML file which allows you to control things like headers, the blurb, problems (including versions), etc. (This is mostly done, but is missing features and the command-line tool isn't written.)
    \item `Finalizing' a document XML file: marks that the contained problems were \texttt{usedin} a given year, so that we can check for recent usage.
    \item Edit tool automatically organizing the XML in a canonical way.
    \item Further criteria: has a TODO in solution or rubric, by year (after, before, unknown)
  \end{itemize}
