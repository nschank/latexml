  \begin{itemize}
    \item Move to 'templates' that documents can be built into 
    \item Possibly figure out a way to avoid the stupid \&amp; and \&lt; things.

    \item Finalize should render the final TeX documents for archival, so that 
    we are no longer dependent on the problems staying in the same place.
  \end{itemize}
