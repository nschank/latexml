\section{Installation}
  To use \LaTeX ML, you must be using some version of Python 2, and must have \texttt{pdflatex} installed on your system. The following Python packages are also required:
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{argparse}
    \item \texttt{xml}
  \end{itemize}
  
  \subsection{Requests and Complaints}
    Please tell Nick the moment something doesn't work, or something is harder than it should be. This is meant to simplify your life significantly: if there is a particular tool you think might help you write things more efficiently, Nick would love to at least hear about it (or tell you why it's impossible, that's fun too). If something is confusing or buggy, also say so -- I can't fix something if I don't know it's broken!
    
    Also feel free, if you are good with Python, to submit a pull request in git.
