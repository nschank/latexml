      % Some comment
      % Comment w/ escaped percent sign: \%
      %%% Comment starting w/ multiple percents
      Here's some math: $3 + 3 = 6$ % and here's a comment
      % Yes.
      Look a percent sign: \%. Isn't it great?
      Hard newline then comment: \\%this is a comment.
      % p break:

      \begin{verbatim}%
      % Unescaped % percent % signs are allowed here.
      As are backslashes and such \%\\%%% Hello. %
      \end{verbatim}% This is a line comment.

      We want to keep comment env in its entirety:
      \begin{comment}% This should stay
      This is inside the comment environment.
          It (\%) should stay.\\ % So should I.
      \end{comment} This should leave.
      In the generated tex, there is a comment block above this sentence.

    <rubric>Rubric:

      The comments should get stripped out such that, in the generated tex file,
      the Problem and Solution have the same contents.

      Also, this file fails validation, because its tests include raw
      newlines.
