# latexml
Tools for building and managing assignments and problems for CSCI0220.

See doc/documentation.pdf for a complete rundown of how to set up and use the tool.

Run `python tests.py` within the main LaTeXML directory to ensure that it is currently running correctly. Note that it will not run except in the LaTeXML directory, due to relative linking of the `test/` directory.
